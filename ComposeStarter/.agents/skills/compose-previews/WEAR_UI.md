# Material 3 Expressive Design for Wear OS

Material 3 Expressive (M3) is the latest evolution of Google's design language for Wear OS, designed to meet user demand for modern, relevant, and distinct experiences. It moves beyond "clean and boring" designs to create interfaces that connect with users on an emotional level.

## Core Design Principles
Material 3 Expressive is built on four pillars:
- **Modern**: Reflecting current design trends and user expectations.
- **Relevant**: Tailored to individual user preferences and context.
- **Distinct**: Providing a unique and recognizable identity.
- **Expressive**: Utilizing motion, color, and shapes to evoke specific emotions.

## Development Setup: Modules & Packages

To build for Wear OS using Material 3, use the following **androidx.wear.compose** libraries. **Important**: Always use the `material3` variants and avoid the legacy `material` (M2) modules.

### Recommended Dependencies (v1.6.0+)
| Feature | Artifact / Module |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Material 3** | `androidx.wear.compose:compose-material3` |
| **Foundation** | `androidx.wear.compose:compose-foundation` |
| **Navigation** | `androidx.wear.compose:compose-navigation` |
| **Tooling** | `androidx.wear.compose:compose-ui-tooling` |

### Primary Packages
- **Design System**: `androidx.wear.compose.material3` (e.g., `Text`, `Button`, `MaterialTheme`)
- **Layout & Lists**: `androidx.wear.compose.foundation` and `androidx.wear.compose.foundation.lazy`
- **Navigation**: `androidx.wear.compose.navigation` (e.g., `SwipeDismissableNavHost`)
- **Previews**: `androidx.wear.compose.ui.tooling.preview`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** include a dependency on `androidx.compose.material:material` or `androidx.wear.compose:compose-material`. Material 3 for Wear OS (`compose-material3`) is designed as a standalone replacement.

### App-Specific UX Principles
- **Focused**: Help users complete critical tasks within seconds.
- **Shallow and Linear**: Avoid hierarchies deeper than two levels; display content and navigation inline when possible.
- **Vertical-First**: Optimize for vertical layouts to allow single-direction traversal.

## App Surfaces & Best Practices
An app is a primary surface on Wear OS, offering richer interactivity than tiles or complications.

### Key Guidelines
- **Time Display**: Always show the time (overlay) at the top for consistency.
- **Primary Actions**: Elevate the most important actions to the top of the interface.
- **Inline Entry Points**: Settings and preferences should be accessible inline with clear iconography.
- **Responsive Margins**: Use **percentage margins** so the layout adapts to the display's curve.
- **Breakpoints**: Consider a breakpoint at **225dp** to introduce more content or improve glanceability on larger screens.
- **Scroll Indicators**: Only display scrollbars on screens that actually scroll to maintain correct user expectations.

## Technical Implementation & Code Choices

### 1. Screen Architecture
Use a hierarchical scaffolding approach to manage system UI (TimeText, Scroll Indicator) and screen-specific content:
- **`AppScaffold`**: The root container for the entire application.
- **`ScreenScaffold`**: Used for individual screens. Manages the `scrollState` and provides a slot for `EdgeButton`.
- **`SwipeDismissableNavHost`**: Essential for the "back" gesture (swipe-to-dismiss).

### 2. Scrolling & Lists
The preferred list component in M3 Expressive is **`TransformingLazyColumn`** (which succeeds `ScalingLazyColumn`).
- **State Management**: Use `rememberTransformingLazyColumnState()`.
- **Visual Effects**: Apply `rememberTransformationSpec()` and `SurfaceTransformation` to items to enable expressive shape-morphing and scaling as they scroll.
- **Dynamic Height**: Use `Modifier.transformedHeight` within items to ensure they scale correctly.
- **Vertical Content Spacing**: Avoid using Horologist for list padding. Instead, use **`Modifier.minimumVerticalContentPadding`** on individual items.
    - Pair this with specific defaults like `CardDefaults.minimumVerticalListContentPadding`, `ButtonDefaults.minimumVerticalListContentPadding`, or `TextButtonDefaults.minimumVerticalListContentPadding` to ensure correct spacing relative to screen edges and other items.

### 3. Key Components
- **`EdgeButton`**: A hallmark M3 pattern for round devices. It hugs the bottom edge of the screen and is the ideal place for the primary CTA.
- **`ButtonGroup`**: For side-by-side actions (e.g., Two iconic `FilledIconButton`s).
- **`TitleCard` / `AppCard`**: Use these for content groupings. Custom colors can be applied via `AppCardDefaults`.
- **`ListHeader`**: Standardized header for list sections.
- **`AlertDialog`**: Use the Material 3 version with `AlertDialogDefaults.ConfirmButton` and `DismissButton`.

### 4. Styles & Tokens
- **Color**: Target `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` (e.g., `primary`, `secondary`, `surfaceContainerLow`).
- **Shapes**: Use `IconButtonDefaults.animatedShapes()` for expressive, morphing interaction feedback.
- **Typography**: Utilize variable font axes (Roboto Flex) for dynamic weight/width changes during motion.

### 5. System UI & Time Display
- **`TimeText`**: Most screens (excluding dialogs) should display the system time. This is typically handled by placing `TimeText` within the **`AppScaffold`**.
- **`AppScaffold` Consistency**: Because `AppScaffold` is often defined at the root of the app, individual screens inherit the system UI.
- **Preview Recommendation**: When creating `@Preview` functions for individual screens, wrap the content in an **`AppScaffold`** (or a custom theme wrapper that includes it) to ensure the time text is visible and correctly positioned in the generated preview image.

## Tiers of Expression
Designers can gauge their app's implementation across three levels:
1. **Foundational**: Core Material 3 elements applied consistently.
2. **Excellent**: Enhanced use of color, typography, and motion for a premium feel.
3. **Transformational**: Fully immersive and unique experiences that push the boundaries of the design system.

## Research-Backed Benefits
Material 3 Expressive is Google's most researched design update:
- **Aesthetics**: Users perceived expressive designs as up to 170% more aesthetically pleasing.
- **UX Preference**: Expressive variants saw an approximately 100% increase in user preference over baseline designs.
- **Accessibility**: Employs "accessible-by-default" styles, often exceeding minimum standards for tap target size and color contrast.
- **Emotional Connection**: Fine-tuned to evoke positive vibes—"playful," "energetic," and "friendly."
